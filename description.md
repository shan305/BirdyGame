The `import` statements at the beginning of the code bring in external modules into your Python script, allowing you to use functionalities provided by those modules. In this case, the three imports are:

1. **`import pygame`**:
   - **Explanation:** Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It provides functionalities for handling graphics, events, sound, and more. In this script, Pygame is used for creating the game window, handling user input, and drawing graphics.

2. **`import sys`**:
   - **Explanation:** The `sys` module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. In this script, `sys` is used to exit the game cleanly when the user closes the window or to terminate the script in response to certain events.

3. **`import random`**:
   - **Explanation:** The `random` module provides functions for generating pseudo-random numbers. In this script, `random` is used to determine the initial height of the hurdles and to randomize their positions. This adds variability to the game, making it more challenging and interesting.

In summary, these imports allow the script to leverage external functionalities: Pygame for game development, `sys` for handling system-related tasks, and `random` for generating random values in the game. Each import contributes specific capabilities to the overall functionality of the Flappy Bird game.




1. **Initialization (Constructor):**
   - Description: Sets up the initial state of the game, including Pygame initialization, display settings, colors, images, and various attributes for the bird and hurdles.

2. **Draw Title Screen:**
   - Description: Handles the drawing of the title screen, displaying background images, the game title, and instructions to start the game.

3. **Draw Score:**
   - Description: Manages the drawing of the score during active gameplay, creating a background for the score display and rendering the current score.

4. **Draw Score at End:**
   - Description: Draws the background and score text when the game is over, indicating the final score and the option to restart.

5. **Reset Game:**
   - Description: Resets the game state to its initial conditions, placing the bird and hurdles at their starting positions, resetting the score, and preparing for a new game.

6. **Handle Title Screen Events:**
   - Description: Listens for events during the title screen, such as quitting the game or pressing the spacebar to start the game.

7. **Handle Events:**
   - Description: Handles events during active gameplay, responding to user input (e.g., spacebar presses) to make the bird jump or restart the game.

8. **Update Game State:**
   - Description: Updates the game state based on the current conditions, including simulating gravity, moving the hurdles, checking for collisions, updating the score, and progressively increasing hurdle speed.

9. **Draw Elements:**
   - Description: Draws various elements on the screen based on the current game state, including the background, bird, hurdles, and score. Handles different scenarios such as the title screen, active gameplay, and game over.

10. **Game Loop in run.py:**
    - Description: Executes the main game loop, continuously handling events, updating the game state, and drawing elements to create a smooth and interactive gaming experience.
